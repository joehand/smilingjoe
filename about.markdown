The project started at my birth when I emerged with a smile on my face. Ever since then I have enjoyed helping others around me find their own happiness. Through __experiments in kindness__ I will help others find their own smile while addressing contentious issues.

Most people know me as Joe Hand, but feel free to call me Smiling Joe, Smiles, or whatever pleases you. I started this journey with a simple idea of giving out chocolate chip cookies to strangers. I hope you enjoy the ride, I know I will.
