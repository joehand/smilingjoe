<h3>The Man Behind the Smile</h3> 
<p class="half-bottom">Most people know me as <a href="{{ site.home_url }}">Joe Hand</a>, but feel free to call me Smiling Joe, Smiles, or whatever pleases you. I started this journey with a simple idea of giving out chocolate chip cookies to strangers. I hope you enjoy the ride, I know I will.</p> 

 
<h3>The Smiling Goal</h3> 
 
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced&mdash;or seemed to face&mdash; the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on <em>you</em> with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.&rdquo;</p> 
 
<blockquote><p><strong>~F. Scott Fitzgerald</strong>,  <em>The Great Gatsby</em></p></blockquote></blockquote>
