This summer and beyond I hope to provide many people with thoroughly delicious cookies. I want to do this in a way that people can trust me and feel what they are eating is safe. In order to do so I will be getting a food handlers card and a domestic kitchen license. 

_Warning: Shameless plug for donations follows._

As any economics major knows-- there is no free lunch. As much as I would love to do this all for free, I can't. So, if you support what I am doing, enjoy my cookies, or just want more smiles, please consider donating. [Donate away](https://www.wepay.com/donate/128714) if you like cookies. Ill have more info here soon.

In an effort to encourage support I will keep all my monetary costs as transparent as possible on this page.

####Costs

*	Food Handlers Card: $10
*	Domestic Kitchen License: $160
*	Cookie Ingredients: Depends on how many cookies (calculating)
