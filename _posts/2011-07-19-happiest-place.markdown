title: The Only Place In The World Where You Can Find Happiness

meta_description:

Searching Google for ___happiest place in world___ yields almost three million results. Millions of top ten lists fight to reach the top ten spots on the first search page. A self-proclaimed grump, Eric Weiner, even took it upon himself to fly around the world searching for the world's happiest place in the book _<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044669889X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=smijoe-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=044669889X">The Geography of Bliss</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=smijoe-20&l=as2&o=1&a=044669889X&camp=217145&creative=399369" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />_. 

Nine different countries and one happy US city later he concludes the destination of happiness can be reached through many paths:
>Money matters, but less than we think and not in the way that we think. Family is important. So are friends. Envy is toxic. So is excessive thinking. Beaches are optional. Trust is not. Neither is gratitude.

With so many different ways to happiness how can you know what path is right for you? Perhaps it is not about the journey but the people you meet along the way. The author reconsiders one of the people he met on his journey and decides "happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people... happiness is not a noun or verb. It's a conjunction. Connective tissue." So it must be more about the people than the actual place. Now we are left to wonder how to find these relationships that make us happy. 

Even after trotting the globe trying to discover happiness he ends his journey "not 100 percent happy. Closer to feevty-feevty." Unfortunately, no one informed him of the true, happiest place on earth. You cannot find it on any of the top ten lists on Google. And no, it is not Disney World.

#The Way to Happiness

I offer you a simple three step process for the way to happiness:

1.	Buy a plane ticket to Denmark.
2.	Pack your stuff, fly there.
3.  Arrive in world's happiest place, be happy.

Foolproof right? Year after year Denmark ranks as the "[world's happiest nation](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7487143.stm)." So anyone who goes there must be happy. Its the rules.

However, you cannot suddenly become happy by just arriving in Denmark and any fool knows this. __To find true happiness, it must come from inside__. Sure you can enjoy a beautiful place, wonderful food, or a great concert. But unless you have the right attitude, nothing external will make you happy. 

>There is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way.
>>Thich Nhat Hanh

##Cultivating Happiness
I talked briefly at the end of [my last post]({{ site.blog_url }}/07/2011/intro/) about planting the seed for this attitude. First you must be aware of what you can and cannot control. Things happen. Great things, terrible things. Unless you are a wizard or have a time machine you are powerless to change the past. But you still have a great power within you. 

You have the power to control your thoughts. Every event summons a reaction within your mind. Start to nurture the attitude that you have the superpower of authority over your mind. Be attentive to your immediate response to any external event. Begin to work on acknowledging your knee-jerk thoughts, then let them pass by, as if they were a small cloud in an otherwise blue sky.
####Keep the Sky Blue
_Cultivate a blue sky in your mind_. Actively strive to keep that sky clear of nasty thoughts and intentions-- ___for that is the only place in the world where you can find happiness___.



###Find Your Smile, Find Happiness

On the author's final leg of his journey, he recounts a serendipitous meeting with the airport bartender. The bartender's name, of course, "Happy." Without hesitation the author asks him what the secret of happiness is. His answer, simple:
>"Just keep on smiling. Even when you're sad. Keep on smiling."
