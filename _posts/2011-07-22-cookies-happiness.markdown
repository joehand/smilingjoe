title: Cookies and Learning Happiness

I love baking chocolate chip cookies. For years I have worked to make my cookies better: slightly varying the amount of one ingredient or another, changing the baking time or temperature. Sometimes I fail terribly but most lead me closer to the ideal form of the chocolate chip cookie I am searching for. 

Making cookies involves combining certain ingredients in a certain manner and then acting on that mixture by putting them in the oven. I really like brown sugar and chocolate chips. I also like pizza. If I decided to make cookies replacing flour with pizza and the butter and eggs with more sugar and chocolate, I will end up with a mess in my kitchen and no cookies. I can also create the perfect combination of the necessary ingredients then put them in the microwave to bake. Once again, no cookies and messy kitchen. Perfecting cookies requires perfecting the two essential parts: right ingredients and right baking.

Sadly humans have not always known how to make cookies. We learned, we experimented, and even still some people like one type of cookie over another or less sugar and more chocolate. With happiness we each have our own brand of happiness. But just like you cannot make cookies from pizza, you cannot make happiness from anger.

We all have a common cupboard from which we pull our ingredients for happiness. Pursuing happiness entails learning which ingredients suit you and acting on those ingredients correctly. ___Right mind and right action.___

>The first step in seeking happiness is learning. We first have to learn how negative emotions and behaviors are harmful to us and how positive emotions are helpful.

##The Power of Our Mind

In my definitive guide on [the happiest place on Earth]({{ site.blog_url }}/07/2011/happiest-place/) I told you about your superpower. Humans have the amazing power to change how their brain works and control our own minds. Pretty fascinating really, if you like that neuroscience stuff. The process of learning builds new neural pathways within our brain. In English, that means when we do something a lot our brain gets more efficient working in that way. 

Think about the brain as a network of roads of all sizes and shapes. Our habits, the things we are really good at, use the superhighways that we build over time by doing that action again and again. Meanwhile, if we go to learn a new foreign language we start the process of creating a new road from scratch-- or perhaps you know a few words and have a trail through the woods. 

###The Highways of Happiness
The first step in discovering happiness is learning. We have taught our brain throughout life to respond in certain ways. If we regularly get angry or upset-- that is the highway in our brain. Meanwhile, the highway of compassion or kindness may be non-existent. Without building the habits of happiness producing thoughts, we cannot expect to be happy.

In _The Art of Happiness_, The Dalai Lama describes his reaction to tragic or sad events as causing a "ripple on the surface of an ocean" which does not effect him deep down. He has a happiness super-highway from a lifetime of training. But if you have a disposition towards anger, an event that upsets you skips the happy highway. Instead your thoughts opt for the anger highway because it is the path of least resistance. What could be small ripples turns into bigger and bigger waves the further it proceeds down that road. 

We must habituate ourselves to create new mental pathways while destroying the old edging us ever closer to the right attitude and therefore happiness.

>Happiness depends more on the inward disposition of mind than on outward circumstances.
>>__Benjamin Franklin__

##Happiness as a Math Problem

The mathematical beauty of baking attracts me to making cookies. I love to understand how certain ingredients combine with others. I learned how baking soda or baking powder create different reactions, how a yolk or egg whites change the cookies. Then comes the ultimate problem of finding the correct dough size, oven temperature, and baking time. 

Developing the right attitude of happiness works the same way. With every action or thought we have the chance to either lead us closer or move away from our goal. When learning how to be happy, we must realize two things: 

*	Positive thoughts and actions generate more positive thoughts and actions.
*	Negative thoughts and actions propagate to make us angrier, which leads to more negative actions.

#Act Now
For every negative thought you discard and turn into a positive, they do not simply cancel out. Wake up the day and start with a positive thought rather than "ugh morning." This one thought will build on itself turning the day around. Looking at our attitude in relation to others we see the true power of the math of happiness. 

Just like in our own minds, negative emotions hurt others and cause more waves of sadness throughout the world. Whereas right mind, right action spreads more happiness. 

___So which side are you on? Do you want to make your family, your community, and the world more miserable? Or do you want to propagate joy?___
