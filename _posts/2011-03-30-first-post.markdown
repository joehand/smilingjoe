#Welcome

Welcome to the blog of Joe Hand. You have managed to find the very first post.

##Introduction

My name is Joe. I live in __Portland, Oregon__. I love it here. I work at TextFlow Media. We develop digital textbooks. Our future is exciting with <a href="http://seamlesspublishing.com">Seamless Publishing</a>.

I try to understand more about things like sustainable digital publishing models, creative destruction in economics and life, transportation and livability, and being a more efficient person.

##Technology Behind The Pages

As of this post, I am in the process of creating a fresh website and blog. All of the base html and css came from <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">html5boilerplate</a>. I am using Jekyll and GitHub for the blog. 

###The Power of Jekyll and GitHub

I set the blog up using Jekyll and GitHub. The whole process was pretty painless. The short run down goes like this:
<ul>
<li>Create GitHub Account</li>
<li>Install Git and add SSH key</li>
<li>Make a New Repository: <em>username.github.com</em></li>
<li>Fork another public Jekyll site</li>
<li>Edit to satisfaction, make post, and git push</li>
</ul>

Straighforward documentation for <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> alongside tons of examples makes it easy. <a href="http://ksornberger.com/blog/blogging-with-jekyll-and-github/">This tutorial</a> explains the details. See this blog at <a href="https://github.com/joehand/joehand.github.com">github</a>.


###Html5BoilerPlate

The Html5BoilerPlate provides an easy to use foundation for a new site. I used parts of it for my blog and homepage. They have great documentation and make it very easy to customize, check it out. They also include a sweet build script.

I use the build script for joehand.org. It makes things pretty nice. I may try to figure out how to work that with Jekyll someday.


##Why another freaking blog?

I set up this blog with the main goal of improving my writing skills. The topics of the posts will be anything I find fascinating.
