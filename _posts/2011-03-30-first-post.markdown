##Welcome

This is the first post of my blog. I set it up using Jekyll and GitHub. The whole process was pretty seamless. The documentation is pretty good and there are plenty of sites using it for reference.


I have my website, <a href="http://joehand.org">joehand.org</a> set up on a private git repo hosted on Dreamhost. That setup was a little more difficult. Someday I will do a bit more complete documentation on that.


Both sites (my blog and mainpage) use the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">html5boilerplate</a>. I have not figured out if/how to combine the sweet build script with the Jekyll stuff. Not sure if that is possible or necessary. I do use it for my homepage though.


##Introduction

Someday this will go in a more permanent about section, but for now it goes here.


My name is Joe. I live in __Portland, Oregon__. I love it here. I work at TextFlow Media. We develop online textbooks. Our future looks bright with <a href="http://seamlesspublishing.com">Seamless Publishing</a>.


I root for the Portland Trail Blazers. I ski at Mt Hood Meadows. My dart team, Rings of Fire, was the 2010 C League Champions. I tore my achilles playing Ultimate Frisbee for the Reed College Berserk.
