title: Dangers of Reaching The National Bullshit Ceiling


meta_description:

The Daily Show recently discussed the <strong>National Bullshit Ceiling</strong> and the threat it poses to the country. Daily Show correspondent, Jason Jones, warned us of the impending doom if we pass the limit:

>If we reach the point where the amount of bullshit exceeds the amount of things we will effectively default on reality.

We already see how this political culture affects our current environment. Our representatives argue with false pretenses. We disregard the truth for the sake of profit or ideology. Individuals now get identified by their parties not what they represent. However, the real harm will be passed on to future generations. 

The true damage of the current political culture comes in the form of the dissatisfaction and ambivalence of young voters, which I myself am a part of. I find myself increasingly discouraged by politics. I do not see significant progress being made and am especially frustrated by how we value short-term rewards over long-term investments. I will be the first to admit, I am as guilty in my apathy as any other young voter. I have only been motivated to vote in one of the six elections I could vote it. Take a guess which one (hint: it involved the promise of change). 

In the short-term, young generations will be poorly represented and discriminated against in policies. But long-term effects will be catastrophic. ___As a generation we are being raised with a distrust towards politicians___. We see a lack of ethics our leaders and develop a pessimistic attitude, sometimes completely dismissing anything political. What will happen when the young become the old and the country needs people to run it? Who should we look to as role models?

I started this post with the idea of motivating myself and other young voters to care about politics. As I continue in my exploration, I keep wondering, why should we care? The future is a long ways away, yet many of the politicians do not think beyond the past. How could they possibly help us? But it's we who need to help them.

##The Beasts of Politics

>Politics devoid of ethics does not further human welfare, and life without morality reduces humans to the level of beasts. This leads some of us to refrain from politics altogether, but politics is not axiomatically dirty. Rather, the misguided instruments of our political culture have distorted our high ideals and nobel aspirations.

Our political culture is one of beasts. There is no doubting that. But by refusing to engage our leaders, we are just as guilty of driving our country towards failure. We need to take initiative and hold our leaders accountable. We need to set an example of truth telling and living with integrity. Every interaction, every discussion, every decision we make either compounds the problems or helps to solve them.

###Take Initiative, Stop the Bullshit

In the Daily Show clip, Jason Jones called for action. He proposed a solution of "replacing shit with FARTS from our BUTTS." Beyond the obvious comical genius here, the Daily Show team was spot on calling for:

<ul class="no-bullet" style="float:left; margin-right:20%; margin-left:10%">
	<li><b class="big">F</b>actual</li>
	<li><b class="big">A</b>ssessments of</li>
	<li><b class="big">R</b>eality based</li>
	<li><b class="big">T</b>ruths</li>
</ul>

<ul class="no-bullet">
	<li><b class="big">B</b>old</li>
	<li><b class="big">U</b>ncompromising</li>
	<li><b class="big">T</b>ruth</li>
	<li><b class="big">T</b>elling</li>
</ul>

We do not just need this from our politicians, we need this to permeate throughout our society.  Our apathy encourages this culture to strengthen and infect more of our citizens and representatives. Start a revolution by having the courage to stand up and demand an end to bullshit. 

####Act with integrity, act boldly, challenge the bullshit.
