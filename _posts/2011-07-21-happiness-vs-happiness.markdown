The fate of mankind rests on the ability for individuals to pursue happiness. Throughout life people seek to maximize happiness and minimize suffering. But in order to succeed, we must work together.

###Teaching Happiness
Strangely many of us go through more than twelve years of schooling without ever taking a class on how to be happy.

Perhaps finding happiness is so easy we do not need to teach it. Or maybe we learn how to be happy in every class because of the importance of happiness. No, the responsibility must fall on parents to teaching kids how to be happy. Well surely happiness cannot be taught, it must be learned from life. Yes, that _must_ be the answer, ___you learn how to be happy by living___. Therefore, every adult has the duty to show children how to live with genuine happiness.

When a parent tells a child to eat their veggies or to stop watching TV and do their homework, they do so for the child's own good. Parents force the child to forgo the short-term sensory happiness of television for their long-term happiness. The child may not agree or understand how studying will make them happy, but the adults know. Yet so many adults act like children when seeking happiness.

Short-term interests plague the country. Looking at any of the problems the country faces-- economic issues, obesity, never-ending legal battles, or war-- adults everywhere pursue the quickest route to pleasure mistaking it for happiness. Sadly, many of these actions ignore the personal and social consequences over time.

>Our tendency is to rush in and do what seems to promise the shortest route to satisfaction. But in doing so, all too frequently we deprive ourselves of the opportunity for a greater degree of fulfillment.
>>__The Dalai Lama__, Ethics for the New Millennium <small>(p. 53)</small>

The harmless super-sizing of a meal, fighting for every cent of profit, or neglecting a group of people for the richer lobbyists on the other side-- all of these actions feel great right now. They feel like the path to happiness. But these acts only lead to a desire for more. More food, more money, more power. Gluttony precedes more problems. ___When our indulgence causes suffering for others is when we lose our humanity and become beasts.___

##The Humanity of Genuine Happiness

Genuine happiness. A tricky idea. Too often our desire for satisfaction leads us to satiating our brute impulses, mistaking them for happiness. But rather than seeking happiness externally, we must realize that happiness is not a thing that can be reached but an attitude, a state of being. More importantly, the right actions follow from right attitude. But, here comes the real shocker, right actions help on the path to right attitude. Showing kindness, compassion, love, or concern for others does not diminish the sense of yourself.

Whether you like it or not, you are dependent on others and others on you. This is the beauty of humanity. If we all work for personal pleasure while making others suffer, we will all suffer. But everyone can pursue happiness together and we can all enjoy a bigger slice of the pie.

>We come into the world as the result of others' actions. We survive here in dependence on others. Whether we like it or not, there is hardly a moment of our lives when we do not benefit from others' activities. For this reason, it is hardly surprising that most of our happiness arises in the context of our relationships with others.
>>__The Dalai Lama__, Ethics for the New Millennium <small>(p. 62)</small>

#Act Now

Developing a sense of inner peace and the right attitude can take years or a lifetime. It can only be achieved through patience and hard work. But nothing stops you from helping others on the path to genuine happiness. The remarkable thing is, it will help you along your path too.

*	___Worry less___ about your own suffering or sadness.
*	___Show concern___ for a friend or stranger.
*	Guide them towards happiness with ___compassion and kindness___.
*	Realize you have just taken a step towards your own happiness.

####Do you want to be an animal or a human?

Are you going to make your inner child eats all the veggies before it leaves the table? Or learn something rather than watch TV?
