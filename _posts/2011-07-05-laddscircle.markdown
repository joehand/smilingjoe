title: Following Up on Ladd's Circle
	
number: 1.5
description: After a positive response from my first experiment the stop sign issue was, well, still an issue. A post about the experiment on <a href=http://bikeportland.org/2011/07/01/solution-for-ladd-circle-stop-sign-issue-cookies-55819>BikePortland.org</a> followed with some great discussion on the problems, possible solutions, and related topics. Quickly I realized (drawing from my math and economics background) my real interest lies in solving problems, not simply addressing them. Along with sun and fireworks, research into roundabout design and watching behavior in Ladd's filled my weekend. With my second post (and follow up experiment) I bring you a more detailed look at the problems, current solutions from elsewhere, ideas to create a space everyone can safely enjoy, and of course <b>more cookies</b>.

_Note: I have no training in traffic planning or civil engineering, I just like to pretend I do sometimes. What follows are ideas I gathered from others that I feel will help to solve the problems in the circle. Feel free to naysay, just don't tell me my cookies are bad._

####The Short and Sweet
*	The current traffic controls in the circle are not working, there are better solutions that will make everyone happier and safer.
*	I will be making more cookies this week and giving them to people. People could be you. Keep reading or find out more [here]({{ site.updates_url }}).

###Introduction

Lots of commenters added some great conversation about experiment #1 on the <a href=http://bikeportland.org/2011/07/01/solution-for-ladd-circle-stop-sign-issue-cookies-55819>BikePortland.org post</a>. Three main topics stood out:

*	Details about current design concerns and possible solutions
*	Worries related to communication (lack of signals and headphones)
*	Distrust of cookies from a stranger

First, I will undertake the issue of not trusting my cookies. I understand the reasons here. But I would love to help more people to enjoy my cookies. 

In the last post I briefly mentioned some of the current problems. I have a greater grasp on the situation after reading the comments and spending more time observing traffic patterns in the circle. This post will hammer out the details on prevailing concerns. 

Finally, I will present other solutions used worldwide and discuss how those approaches solve the issues we have. (Jump down to the [solutions](#solution).)

Most importantly, the post acts as an announcement of my next batch of free cookies. Just want to find out when and where without scrolling? Check out [this page]({{ site.updates_url }}).

#### Yummy Cookies you can Trust
This summer and beyond I hope to provide many people with thoroughly delicious cookies. I want to do this in a way that people can trust me and feel what they are eating is safe. In order to do so I will be getting a food handlers card and a domestic kitchen license. Check out the sidebar to see how you can help.

####Recap of Experiment #1

Last week I set out to give a bunch of free cookies to strangers biking home after a long day of work. In my attempt to kill two birds with one stone (make cyclists happy they have a cookie and make neighbors happy cyclists stopped), I set up at the stop sign approaching Ladd's Circle in SE Portland. Problem solved, I dramatically increased the number of cyclists stopping making it safer for pedestrians to cross (I created additional traffic problems but let's not talk about those, yet). After extensive analysis of the data I concluded the following:

>__"Replace every controversial stop sign with a fresh chocolate chip cookie dispenser. Now, obviously this will be delicious. Sadly this is not a long term solution."__

##A Happy Circle

Ladd's Circle is a beautiful place. According to the [Portland Parks website](http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&PropertyID=221&c=38308), Ladd's Addition was considered a "radical departure" from common street patterns when William Ladd build it. My cookies-as-a-stop sign experiment was a similarly radial departure, but it worked!

I believe working together we can find a more permanent solution that will make a better public space for everyone. The bad news- it will take some out of the box thinking, a neighborhood and city willing to try things differently, and users treating others with respect.

###An unhappy circle?
Right now Ladd's Circle is an unhappy circle. Stop signs force road users to do something that seems unnatural and unnecessary. Non-compliance of those stop signs makes pedestrians unsure of the behavior of those road users creating unsafe conditions.

Even with all the seemingly dangerous conditions and illegal behavior there are very few reported crashes. So whats the real issue? Anger. 

This anger comes from both sides. 

Pedestrians __expect__ road users to stop because that is the law-- there is both a stop sign and cross walk. When they try to cross and find people not stopping they feel threatened and most likely become angry.
Attempts to deal with the problem through anger have resulted in the following actions:

<aside class="sidenote">
#####Other positive approaches

_I am not sure how I missed this, but thanks to [Mia Birk](http://www.miabirk.com/blog) for pointing it out._

On her [blog](http://www.miabirk.com/blog/?p=872) she tells the story of how they worked to address the same issue last week. Along the same line as cookies, they help up signs reminding road users about the crosswalk laws. Not with anger but with courtesy! And of course, people left the circle with smiles on their faces.
</aside>

*	Educational police stings to warn/cite road users for not stopping.
_Road users know there is a stop sign there. Stopping them to educate them about the signs does not help, it makes them angry--especially the ones that pay over $200 for that education._
*	Invisible trip wires to force people to stop with the help of gravity and hard pavement.
_Anger is written all over this from both sides. Angry person set up wire. Road users feel threatened and most likely become angry._


I think it is time we take a different approach and find a real solution to the problem. A real solution makes both sides happy, makes everyone safer, and makes a better public place everyone can enjoy.

##Possible Solutions
<span class="link" id="solution"/>

This is the real meat of this post. In this section I will go through the solutions that best solve the problems we are facing. I am proposing a three stage solution. Each stage gradually creates a nicer public place while increasing safety.

By solving the problem in three stages will accomplish several goals:

*	At each stage the problem can be evaluated and better solutions proposed
*	Less risk for the city
*	Easier for everyone to adapt behavior


###Solution Part 1

Ok I am just going to say it. __Change the stop signs to yield signs.__ 

>In a statement in from 2007(!) PBOT said "more is needed to make Ladd Circle operate safely than just changing the STOP signs to YIELD".  

I agree that more is needed, but I do not agree that we need to wait to make all of those changes at once. Change the signs now, evaluate, make safety adjustments later. The circle is ___LESS SAFE___ for every user right now with some people stopping and others not.

####Problems this Solves:

*	__Expected Behavior=Actual Behavior__ leads to a safer (and happier!) environment. 

It allows pedestrians to make better decisions because they know what road users are doing (i.e. they don't have to look at the cyclists and try to figure out if they are one of the ten that will follow the stop sign).

Road users know that when people ahead of them are stopping they are doing it for a reason (i.e. a pedestrian present or waiting for merging opportunity).

####Remaining Issues:

*	Difficulty for Pedestrians to cross while road users are merging.

#####WHOA Moment
I found this little gem in the roundabout information guide from the US Department of Transportation (it was one of many head slapping moments):

>In all States, drivers are required to either yield or stop for pedestrians in a crosswalk (however, this requirement is often violated, and therefore it is prudent for
pedestrians not to assume that this is the case).
>>[Roundabout: An Informational Guide](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/00067/index.cfm), Chapter 2 Section 2.4.5

__Ouch.__ 

_Side note: If you are having trouble sleeping--print out this informational guide and read it before bed._

#####Dealing with Pedestrians and Merging Vehicles
If you are not a pedestrian you may wonder why there are safety issues with putting a yield sign in. Stick with me and you will soon find out.

I discovered this super helpful video on walking a roundabout. Try to spot the difference from Ladd's. Its small, but important.

<iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PH5LsQkW_o8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Find it? The pedestrian crosses about one cars length before the car starts to merge. 
Check out a real life example at the [Arc du Triumph](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay8aZlsbB0). __Notice the pedestrians crossings about half a block off the circle.__
_Thanks to __Joe Suburban__ in the BikePortland post comments for that video link._

Imagine being in that car you find yourself looking at places in this order:

*	Straight (eyes on the road)
*	Left/Right (looking for pedestrians in crossing)
*	Straight (waiting to be first in merging queue)
*	Left (preparing to merge)

#####Safety Issues In Ladd's
No such merging area exists in Ladd's circle. [Check out the map](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.508512,-122.649331&spn=0.001012,0.002168&t=h&deg=90&z=20). The resulting order is:

*	Straight (waiting to be front in merging queue)
*	Left/Right (look for pedestrian and prepare to merge)

Whoa that was fast. Watching road users I found most skipped looking right. Definitely a safety issue. 

To fix these problems areas, some fancy engineering will need to be done. According to the official roundabout design manual: either the crosswalks will have to move further up the block (making a long walk for pedestrians) or the merge area needs to be moved forward (creating a smaller circle). I will address these in [Solution Part Three](#three). 

But I think there is a better solution. What if the pedestrians don't cross the street at the two major merge points at all? Crazy yes, but crazy enough it may just work.

###Solution Part Deux

Over the weekend I spent several hours on a couple occasions watching traffic and pedestrians move around Ladd's circle (don't worry I had a good book too). All of the road users move in a somewhat expected fashion. Enter the circle, go around it, exit. The pedestrians however are not as fond of their suggested route.

Think about it, for a pedestrian to get from one side of the circle to the other they cross at least three intersections. All of those being merge points where road users are looking in more than one direction. That is--if they take the sidewalks and __LEGAL__ crossings.

<aside class="sidenote">
#####Jaywalking?
_Yes, I believe walking to the middle of the circle (where there is park) is jaywalking. All of the intersections are considered T-intersections the inside of the roundabout is all one constant road--no intersections. Please correct me if I am wrong._
</aside>

The first time I saw a pedestrian do it, I thought nothing of it. A guy with a bag full of cans managed to cross the entire circle while only crossing the street twice. __TWO street crossings!__ Unfortunately both of them were jaywalking.
 
Then I caught sight of something that I could not believe at first. A blind person walking the same route as the guy with the cans. _No way_. She felt safer walking through the middle of the circle than going around. As I sat in shock and thought about it, everything started to make sense.

####The Magic Solution
By providing four crosswalks from mid-block points to the center of the circle will accomplish:

*	Legal and safer access to center park.
*	Shorter walking distance to every point in around edge of circle.
*	Mid-block crossings have greater visibility.
*	Traffic only coming from one direction is easier to navigate.
*	Slow traffic moving around circle by creating visual separation (different color pavement/material).
*	All crossings occur only when road users are looking straight (not merging).

But the real magic is in the math. All sides of all streets connected to the circle can be accessed with between 1-4 crossings! Only one or two of those being at the merge points. Before a pedestrian would have to cross 3-4 merge points to cross the circle. Still confused? Check out my bad drawing:

![Crosswalks]({{ site.imgpath }}walk.jpg "Crosswalks")

See an example this design in real life at St. Armand's Circle. This circle is much larger and has the correct merge--yield sign approach with the correct location for those cross walks. But there are also two crosswalks going to the center circle (red stripes on top right and bottom left of circle).

####Remaining Issues:
*	Engineering challenges.
*	Still requires pedestrians to cross at merge points, just less often.
*	Safety in new crosswalks.
*	Changes to center park for better through access.

I also believe it will be necessary to shorten the distance of these crosswalks. To accomplish this, the parking will be removed and the curbs extended. Creating a smaller circle will create more public space while reducing speed. This idea is central to solution part three.

<span class="link" id="three"/>
###Solution Part Three
The biggest lesson I learned when handing out cookies was that when you give people incentive to stop or slow down, they will. Requiring people to do something with signs and markings only works up to a point. Solution part three is this:

*	Create a space where people WANT to slow down and enjoy it.
*	Entice people to communicate and cooperate by reducing required behavior in the form of signs and markings.
*	Make merging speed an issue with more difficult sight lines and/or turning radii.
*	Less road, more public space.

A great and innovative traffic engineer Hans Monderman followed these principles to ease traffic flow while creating inviting spaces.
>Treat people like idiots and they will act like idiots.
>>__Hans Monderman__

Check out this shared space he created.
<iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3Wte5-_gCDQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It looks chaotic, and it is. That is the point. One of the major issues in the BikePortland comments was a lack of communication through signals and other methods. Out of chaos comes communication. With a stop sign no one feels the need to communicate. Everyone is supposed to stop, then turn right and everyone else knows that.

Watch some videos on the roundabouts Monderman designed and you will see everyone signaling. Why? Kindness creates cooperation. And it is that cooperation that tames the chaos, one decision at a time.

#####Applying this to Ladd's
Imagine approaching Ladd's and about half a block before the circle you go up a little ramp onto the shared space paved by bricks. As you get close to the merge point you cross a pedestrian crosswalk marked only by a different color brick. 

You look left but slow down before trying to merge. A mini park with a bench and tree covers what used to be a concrete island making it harder to see. Finally you see two cyclists already in the circle. They see you and signal they are exiting, you merge into the empty circle. You do so carefully. The nice easy turn into Ladd's is a bit tighter now with the fountain in place of the empty parking spaces.

A pedestrian starts to move from the edge of the circle towards the middle. Unsure of what they are doing you slow down. They see you and wave you ahead as you exit the circle. You finish your ride home with a smile on your face.

###Solution Part Most Important

I neglected to mention one thing throughout this post. Unfortunately, this one thing is perhaps the biggest obstacle to any of this happening.

#####Show me the money

Without safety concerns, PBOT does not think the price tag justifies any of these engineering. But that is what they view it as--traffic control changes.

By separating out all of the big changes that need to be made into small steps a couple things will happen. First, if anything becomes unsafe then the price tag for the next change will be easier to justify. After the first stage if safety is still not an issue, the project becomes more about creating a public space than about curbing danger. Whether PBOT can find funding to create this type of public space is another issue altogether. But I hope that may be easier to solve than making what they view as unnecessary engineering changes. 

##Experiment #2
For my next experiment I will be heading back to Ladd's Circle __this Friday, July 8 at 5pm__. This time I do not plan on giving cyclists cookies at the stop sign. But don't worry, there will be more cookies.

The goals this time are a bit different:

1.	Create a public space where people WANT to slow down and enjoy it.
2.	Encourage cyclists to become pedestrians.
3.	Establish safer pedestrian access to center park.
4.	Promote constructive and kind conversation to move towards the best possible immediate solution.

These goals are quite ambitious compared to my previous experiment.

####Why Ladd's again?
I received a call from a news station wanting an interview with me. I proposed to meet at Ladd's because I was in the area. When I met with them they were confused when I was not handing out cookies. They want a story and video of me handing out cookies. 

Although I am hesitant to do it again in the same place for media--I feel like this is a good opportunity to increase the public awareness of my mission, and issues in Ladd's and Portland in general.

I will have another post up shortly about the details, how you can help, and concerns I have.

Thanks for all the great emails and support so far. It gets me really excited to continue with experiments in kindness!
