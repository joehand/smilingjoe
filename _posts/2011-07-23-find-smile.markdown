###Me and Writing
Throughout school I never enjoyed writing. Everything always felt forced as I tried to conform to standards. I ended up writing with someone else's voice leading to terrible papers.

After writing the experiments in kindness and some personal blog posts, I realized how much I enjoyed writing -- on my terms. But I still felt I needed to work on getting my ideas down with clarity and ease. Any writer will tell you that in order to learn how to write, you write, a lot. So, six days ago I made it a goal to post here everyday for thirty days.

###Serendipity 
Five posts later and I am making progress, but sometimes only with great effort and frustration. I still feel like I am ___finding my voice___. As I began writing today I struggled to start. I headed over to ___[ZenHabits](http://zenhabits.net)___ by [Leo Babauta](http://leobabauta.com), my favorite source for motivation. Lo and behold, a post on [finding your voice](http://zenhabits.net/voice/).

The first tip as expected, ___Write a lot___. Check. The second tip:
>__Experiment boldly__. Rip off the greats, and the goods as well. Mimick and make it your own. Try and err.

I kept reading and within moments I began seeing how finding your voice parallels finding your smile. I decided to "rip off the greats... mimick and make it my own." And thanks to ZenHabits being in the [public domain](http://zenhabits.net/open-source-blogging-feel-free-to-steal-my-content/) I could do so easily.

Thank you Leo for all the great posts and inspiration. If I could only read one blog the rest of my life, I would choose ZenHabits. I encourage everyone to check out [ZenHabits](http://zenhabits.net). ___The remainder of this post was stolen from there and modified without regret.___ I lay claim to none of the hard work and words you will find below.

#Finding Your <strike>Voice</strike> Smile

Humans of any kind must find their smile.

We are writers, musicians, designers, programmers, parents, builders of anything. But we are not truly at peace with ourselves, and genuinely happy, until we've found our smile: the attitude, kindness, compassion, love, personality we use to express ourselves.

Our smile is our essence, plain for the world to see.

A fellow happiness seeker asked me how I found my smile. And I have no easy answer -- I'm not even sure I can say I've fully found my smile yet. It's a quest that doesn't seem to end -- not a Grail quest, really, but a constant retuning as the essence of who I am neverendingly changes.

But I feel I've found something that has the texture of truth, even if only a tactile approximation. I'll share some of my thoughts, but keep in mind I don't hold the answers firmly at all.

I'm learning, and I hope my learning helps yours. This is written for smile seekers, but the ideas are the same for anyone who is human.

__Smile a lot.__ This is almost all I need to say, as nothing else matters without the constant practice of smiling a lot. Try smiling right when you wake up, when you are washing dishes, smile to strangers, find your enemies and smile with them, smile at nature, and smile for yourself. The sheer mass of your smiles becomes the raw matter from which to chisel your happiness.

__Experiment boldly.__ Rip off the greats, and the goods as well. Mimick and make it your own. Try and err.

__Learn to be at peace with yourself.__ My smile is really the happiness in my head. It's not how I assert my happiness, but how I feel my genuine happiness, in the noisy cavern of my skull. I listen to my inner peace and that's the smile I try to emulate.

Getting that happiness from your head to your face -- that's the trick. It's not easy, but again, do it often, and you'll get proficient at it. It's a rewiring of the synapses, so that your head-happiness shoots down into your face muscles and come out as a smile, as kindness and compassion. Most people don't do this enough to get good at it, and so there is low fidelity.

__Find what feels true.__ You'll smile a lot, and most of it will be bullshit. You need bullshit if you want to find the truth. Sort through the bullshit until you recognize the truth, by feel, not by and logical criteria. The truth looks remarkably like bullshit.

__Find clarity.__ Good smiling, it's been said often, is inner peace. If your inner peace is muddled, your smile will be. I'd recommend a self-taught course on meditation, but really I've found it's a matter of simplifying. Practice removing external desires and agendas until you have only what's needed to express a simple smile.

__Remove the negativity.__ It's a process of subtraction more than addition. Most people end up with too many feelings, because they never subtract. Negative feelings get in the way of your smile, so pare it down, trimming the cynical from the bush until you're left with truth. I subtract in my head, these days, but that's from years of practice. After you react, acknowledge your feelings, and remove the negativity.

Most people also have too many detrimental feelings in their own lives to hear their own optimism. Too much is going on around them, and online, and they have no time for solitude. You can't hear your happiness, your inner peace, without solitude. Remove the negativity in your life as well.

__Use your smile.__ You don't embark on a quest for your smile just for the sake of beauty -- a noble pursuit, but it's not enough. 

You must use your smile. Use it to express your happiness, to help others, to change the world.

I smile for kindness in a world that's needlessly barbarous.

I smile for inner happiness to stem the tide of seeking happiness through consumerism.

I smile for contentment because too many feel a lacking.

I smile for compassion because my heart breaks at the cruelty of our species.

I smile for morality in an increasingly unethical world, especially in the growing private sector.

This is how I use my smile. How will you use yours?
