####Next Experiment in Kindness

#####Friday July 8th, 5pm
Once again I will be visiting Ladd's Circle. Same location, new experiment. I am working on my experiment design and getting my hypothesis all squared away. Don't worry, there will be __free cookies__.

So far I know my goals are:

1.	Create a public space where people WANT to slow down and enjoy it.
2.	Encourage cyclists to become pedestrians.
3.	Establish safer pedestrian access to center park.
4.	Promote constructive and kind conversation to move towards the best possible immediate solution.

Ya, ambitious right. That is why I may need your help. Stay tuned for more details. 

If you want to know why I chose those goals, check out my follow up on my first post: [__Experiment#1.5__]({{ site.blog_url }}/07/2011/laddscircle/).

####Experiment #1

For my first experiment, I gave out free cookies at the stop sign approaching Ladd's Circle. Read more about it [here]({{ site.blog_url }}/06/2011/freecookies/).
