title: Make the Cookies

description: Ever since I can remember I made Chocolate Chip Cookies. Ten years ago I discovered a recipe I really liked, memorized it, and spent the next ten years experimenting on slight variations. I always get lots of people asking me for my recipe, so here it is.

The real secret is not what you put in the cookies, but how you make them. So be sure to add lots of love!

###Chocolate Chip Cookies

Follow the directions, make yummy cookies, and share them with your friends.

1.	Start by getting all of your ingredients out in one place. That way you will not forget anything.


	*	2 Cups Flour
	*	1/2 tsp Sea Salt
	*	1/2 tsp Baking Soda
 
2.	Mix dry stuff in bowl, set aside. 
	*	1 c Brown Sugar
	*	1/2 c White Sugar
	*	3/4 c Butter

3.	Mix sugars and butter in new bowl. Melted butter is easier but changes how dough feels.
	*	1 egg
	*	1 egg yolk 
	*	1 tbsp vanilla 

4.	Mix in eggs and vanilla.

5.	Add dry stuff with wet about 1/2 cup at a time and mix.
6.	Add chocolate chips (about 1 cup but really a personal preference here). 

7.	Bake at 325 for 12ish minutes.

The dough is much better if put in the fridge for 24-48hrs wrapped in plastic/tightly covered, especially if you melt the butter it makes it a little tough to work with immediately. Take it out of the fridge 30min before you plan on baking them. 


Good luck and enjoy the cookies.
