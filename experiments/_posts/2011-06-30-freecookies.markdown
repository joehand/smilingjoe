title: Stop for a Free Cookie

number: 1
description: In my first experiment of kindness I gave away free chocolate chip cookies to people at the stop sign approaching Ladd's Circle during the evening commute. Previous evidence showed almost no one stopping. I demonstrated that with proper incentives cyclists are happy to stop. By addressing this issue with positive action I gained a greater understanding of the problems and potential solutions.

_Note: This was my first experiment in kindness. Nothing was scientific in any way. My observations and discussion contain generalizations. This report is a work in progress._

_Disclaimer: My main form of transportation is a bike. I also walk, take the bus, and drive cars occasionally. I worked hard to understand all perspectives._

## Introduction

Debate about the stop signs approaching Ladd's Circle is creating animosity between two parties. Neighbors are unhappy with danger of crossing the circle as a pedestrian. Cyclists have little reason to stop with the current set-up and many do not. As greater numbers of cyclists disregard the sign, the incentive for any one cyclist to stop decreases dramatically. The situation is not optimal for pedestrians or cyclists.

To get cyclists to stop I provided delicious incentives in the form of chocolate chip cookies. This dramatically increased the number of cyclists following the law.

#### Brief Conclusion
In order to create a safe environment for all forms of traffic we need to align incentives and expectations with behavior. This is a difficult task. Offering cookies was enough reason for some to stop, but not everyone. Unexpected stopping caused some issues with cyclists who were trailing closely; one or two people stopping within waves of cyclists caused the most problems. Finally, everyone entering the circle looks left to see if it is clear causing issues with pedestrians crossing from the right.

##### Suggestions

Replace every controversial stop sign with a fresh chocolate chip cookie dispenser. Now, obviously this will be delicious. Sadly this is not a long term solution. 

__Two key points need to be a part of any solution:__

*   Create an environment where the expected behavior of every party is understood and follows the law.
*   Ensure the safety of pedestrians crossing from the right when everyone is looking left to enter the circle.


## Experiment Details

In my first experiment of kindness I decided to hand out chocolate chip cookies to cyclists. In order to have a greater impact, I found a controversial situation and attempted to address it through smiles.

#### Background on Ladd's Circle

Walkers and cyclists both enjoy the beauty of Ladd's Addition, a neighborhood in Portland. Ladd's Circle sits in the middle of the neighborhood as well as several popular bike routes. Currently stop signs require that every cyclist stop before entering the circle. Several of the intersections also have striped pedestrian crossings. A wide road around the circle and clear sight lines allow entering bikes to see and merge easily with existing traffic.

#### Friction between Pedestrian Safety and Cyclists' Incentives    

*   Neighbors in the area worry about failure of cyclists to stop and the ensuing danger to pedestrians attempting to cross.
*   Cyclists have little reason to stop. Clear vision of incoming traffic and easy merging areas enable cyclists to enter the circle at speed without conflict from existing traffic. Stopping  also requires that cyclists expend additional energy.


### Hypothesis

__Cyclists given incentive to stop will do so at a dramatically increased rate.__

#### Design

*   Bake 100 delicious chocolate cookies
*   Set up on main route entering circle for cyclists coming from downtown
*   Hang sign on stop sign saying "STOP for a Free Chocolate Chip Cookie"
*   Tell people I have free cookies for them
*   Hand out free cookies, watch people leave with smiles on their faces

__Timeline:__

The experiment took place on June 29th during the evening rush hour. I ran the experiment until the cookies were gone, approximately 4:45pm to 5:15pm. 

### General Observations

The experiment succeeded in dramatically increasing the number of bikes that stopped. While many people failed to see the sign (no surprise, it was poorly made) people were excited at the prospect of free cookies once they understood what I offered.

Several cyclists and neighbors walking supported my efforts in getting people to stop. Most positive feedback was along these lines. Others were overjoyed with the prospect of food (because they were hungry) and some just excited about a cookie.

Unfortunately, apart from immediate impact there is no way to observe, let alone measure, how my experiment impacted the remainder of people's days. My hope is that I at least helped people to enjoy the rest of their commute.

Finally, the number of people who looked like they really wanted a cookie but had the self-control to not get one was impressive. Some of these were more fitness/diet reasons. But others simply did not trust me. I was disappointed by the unhappy and distrusting glances I got. I understand the reasons people did not want a cookie from a stranger. However, there is no reason to be sour about it.

#### Quick Take Away Thoughts

##### General Notes

*   Talked to some neighbors who were appreciative of my efforts to get people to stop.
*   When entering the circle most people are looking left and less likely to see pedestrians crossing from the right.
*   Some people do not trust cookies from a random smiling stranger.
*   Even some people who did not take a cookie appreciated the experiment.
*   Lots of people walked or biked away smiling.
*   Created some traffic conflicts with pedestrians stopping for cookies and forgetting they were in a road.

##### Notes On Bikers

*   Most people stop when they have personal incentive to do so.
*   Some cyclists managed to get a cookie without stopping. I probably helped them here.
*   Bikers are pretty health conscious. A lot of people saw cookies, considered it, but restrained themselves.
*   A couple people mentioned being really hungry and a cookie was exactly what they needed to get home.
*   People with headphones were mostly oblivious and generally slowed the least.
*   Created additional traffic conflicts with some bikers stopping and others not.

##### Notes On Cars

*   Lots of the cars rolled through. Few stopped completely.
*   Cars exist on a different scale than bikers and walkers. They were very difficult to interact with.
*   Nobody in cars got a cookie. I had no intention to not serve cars but the combination of a steady stream of bikes and being on the opposite side of the driver made it difficult.

## Conclusion

My goals for __experiments in kindness__ are twofold:

1.  Help spread happiness through random acts of kindness.
2.  Address controversial issues with unconventional methods to put fresh perspective on the situation.

### Spreading Happiness

I gave away about 100 chocolate chip cookies to people who were hungry and expending energy to transport themselves home after work. I put a positive light on a negative situation. Even most of those who did not eat a cookie left with a smile on their face. Those that did eat a cookie, well, they probably enjoyed the rest of their ride.

__Success!!__

### Addressing the Issue at Hand

No simple solution will just show up for this issue. The current stop sign treatment does not work. Everyone involved understands that. A police sting to enforce behavior will only cause more traffic issues and animosity towards each other. The cookies were delicious and made people happy, however, people stopping created additional conflicts.

Unexpected behavior makes life more difficult for everyone. If some bikes stop and others continue without stopping pedestrians, fellow cyclists, and drivers will only be more confused and unsafe. In order for everyone to get around safely and happily we need to create an environment that supports different incentives. 

By replacing the stop signs with yield signs we align expected behavior with legal behavior for cyclists. Unfortunately, this causes an unsafe environment for pedestrians. Most of the people entering the circle look left- and only left- while merging. Pedestrians crossing from the right side of the street will not be in the line of sight. To solve this problem more creative engineering feats are required. Perhaps someone can invent a teleporter.

#### Suggested Actions

Until the current set-up changes I suggest we treat each other with respect and courtesy.


__Cyclists:__ Watch for pedestrians crossing from _both sides_ of the street, stop for them, and be alert of other cyclists who are stopping. Use eye contact or nice words to communicate your behavior. Understand that this neighborhood is full of kids and approach the circle with awareness and caution.

__Pedestrians:__ Make yourself easily seen when trying to cross. Use eye contact or nice words to communicate your behavior. Understand that cyclists expend energy when they stop and lots of them are hungry or tired on their commute.
